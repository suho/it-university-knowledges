## What is Arduino

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.

Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twittter message - and turn it into an ouput - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the **Arduino Programming Language**, **IDE**
