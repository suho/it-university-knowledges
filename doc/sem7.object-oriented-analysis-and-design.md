## Concepts

OOAD is a structed method for analyzing, designing a system by applying the object-orientated concepts, and develop a set of graphical system models during the development life cycle of the software.

In the object-oriented analysis:
- **Elicit** requirements: Define what does the software need to do, and what's the problem the software trying to solve.
- **Specify** requirements: Describe the requirements, usually, using use cases or user stories
- **Conceptual** model: Identify the important objects, refine them, and define their relationships and behavior and draw them in a simple diagram.

In the object-oriented design:
- **Describe the classes** and their relationship using class diagram.
- **Describe the interaction** between the objects using sequence diagram.
- **Apply** software design principles and design patterns.

## System Modeling

System modeling is the process of developing models of the system, with each model representing a different perspectives of that system.

### Different Perspective

- **External**, where you model the context or the environment of the system.
- **Interaction**, where you model the interaction between components of a system, or between a system and other systems.
- **Structural**, where you model the organization of the system, or the structure of the data being processed by the system.
- **Behavioral**, where you model the dynamic behavior of the system and how it respond to events.

### Unified Modeling Language (UML)

- Use Case Diagram
- Class Diagram
- Sequence Diagram
- State Machine Diagram
- Activity Diagram

## Conceptual Model

Identifying the most important objects, their relationship and interactions between them.

## Structural, Interaction, and Behavioral Models

Modeling the organization of the system
