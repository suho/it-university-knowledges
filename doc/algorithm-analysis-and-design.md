## Introduction

An algorithm is any well-defined computational procudure that takes some value, or set of rules, as **input** and produces some value, or set of values, as **output**. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.

An algorithm is said to be **correct** if, for every input instance, it halts with the correct output.

## Complexity

Complexity of an algorithm is a measure of the amount of time and/or space required by an algorithm for an input of a given size (n).

## Recursion

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.

- Multiple Recursion
- Mutual Recursion
- Implicated Recursion

## Divide and Conquer

Divide and Conquer is an algorithm design paradigm based on multi-branched recursion.

A divide-and-conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.

## Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. 

Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming

The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-comupute them when needed later
