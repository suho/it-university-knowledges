## Concepts

### System

System is a set of things working together as parts of a mechanism or an interconnecting network. System is also a set of principles or procedures according to which something is done; an organized scheme or method.

### Management Information System

- Data is a set of values of subject with respect to qualitative or quantitative variables.
- Information is the resolution of uncertainly; it is that which answers the question of "what an entity is" so is thus thaat which specifies the nature of that entity, as well as the essentianlity of its properties.

A management information system (MIS) is an information system used for decision-making, and for the coordination, control, analysis, and visualization of information in an organization; especially in a company.

## Informatuon System Analytics Methods

### Concepts

System analysis - the process of studying a procedure or business in order to identify its goals and purpses and create systems and procedures that will achieve them in an efficient way.

### Classical Methods - Structure Oriented

- SADT
- MERISE

### Object Oriented Methods

Object Oriented Analysis - a process that groups items that interact with one another, typically by **class**, **data** or **behavior**, to create a model that accurately representas that indended purpose of the system as a whole.

UML (Unified Modeling Language): A standard language for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems.
