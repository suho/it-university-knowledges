## What is Testing?

Testing is the process of evaluating a system or its component(s) with the intent to find that whether it satisfies the specified requirements or not.

## Testing Types

### Manual Testing

This type includes the testing of the Software manually i.e. without using any automated tool or any script. Use test plan, test cases or test scenarios

### Automation Testing

Automation Testing which is also known as “Test Automation”, is when the tester writes scripts and uses another software to test the software. Used to re-run the test scenarios that were performed manually, quickly and repeatedly

## Testing Methods

### Black Box Testing

The technique of testing without having any knowledge of the interior workings of the app is BLT.

### White Box Testing

White box testing is the detailed investigation of internal logic and structure of the code. Also called glass testing or open box testing.

### Grey Box Testing

GBT is a technique to test the application with limited knowledge of the internal workings of an app. Tester has access to design documents, db, having this knowledge, the tester is able to better prepare test data and test scenarios

## Levels of Testing

### Functional Testing

This is a type of black box testing that is based on the specifications of software that is to be tested. The application is tested by providing input and then the results are examined that need to conform to the functionality it was intended for. Functional Testing of the software is conducted on a complete, integrated system to evaluate the system's compliance with its specified requirements.

#### Unit Testing
Unit testing is performed by the respective developers on the individual units of source code assigned areas.

#### Integration Testing

The testing of combined parts of an application to determine if they function correctly together is Integration Testing.

#### System Testing: 

Once all the components are integrated, the application as a whole is tested rigorously to see that it meets Quality Standards.

#### Regression Testing

Whenever a change in a software application is made it is quite possible that other areas within the application have been affected by this change. To verify that a fixed bug hasn’t resulted in another functionality or business rule violation is Regression testing.
#### Acceptance Testing

Acceptance Testing is arguably the most importance type of testing as it is conducted by the Quality Assurance Team who will gauge whether the application meets the intended specifications and satisfies the client’s requirements

### Non-Functional Testing

Non-functional testing of Software involves testing the Software from the requirements which are non-functional in nature related but important a well such as performance, security, user interface etc.
