## Internet and Web

### Network

A Network is a collection of computers, servers, mainframes, network devices, peripherals, or other devices connected to one another to allow sharing of data. An excellent example of a network is the Internet, which connects millions of people all over thw world.

### Type of network

- Local area networks (LANs): The computers are geographically close together
- Wide area networks (WANs): The computers are farther apart and are connected by telephone lines or radio waves

### What is Internet?

The Internet (interconnected network) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the world wide web (www), electronic email, telephony, and file sharing.

### TCP/IP

TCP/IP - Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. TCP/IP specifies how data is exchanged over the internet by providing end-to-end communications that identify how it should be broken into packets, addressed, transmitted, routed and received at the destination.

The two main protocols in the internet protocol suite serve specific functions:

- TCP defines how applications can create channels of communication across a network. It also manages how a message is assembled into smaller packets before they are then transmitted over the internet and reassembled in the right order at the destination address.

- IP defines how to address and route each packet to make sure it reaches the right destination. Each gateway computer on the network checks this IP address to determine where to forward the message.

### IP Address

Is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

### Domain name

IP address is a numerical, soA domain name is a label that identifies a network domain: a distinct group of computers under a central administration or authority.
Within the Internet, domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS). Any name registered in the DNS is a domain name. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting a web site, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via the Internet. In 2017, 330.6 million domain names had been registered

### Server/Client

Client-Server is a software architecture model consisting of two parts, client systems and server systems, both communication over a computer network or on the same computer. A client-server application is a distributed system made up of both client and server software. 
- The Client process always initiates a connection to the server.
- The Server process always waits for requests from any client.
