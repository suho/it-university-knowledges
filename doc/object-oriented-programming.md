## Software crisis

Sofware crisis:
- How to represent real-life entities of problems in system design?
- How to design system with open interfaces?
- How to ensure reusability and extensibility of modules?
- How to develop modules that are tolerant of any changes in future?
- How to improve software productivity and decrease software cost?
- How to improve the quality of software?
- How to manage time schedules?

## Software Evaluation

Like a tree, the software evolution has had distinct phases "layers" of growth. These layers were building up one by one over the last five decades.

To build today's complex software it is just not enough to put together a sequence of programming statements and sets of procedures and modules.

## POP (Procedure Oriented Programming)

POP basically consists of writing a list of instructions for the computer to follow, and organizing these instructions into groups known as functions.

Some characteristics exhibited by procedure-oriented programming are:
- Emphasis is on doing things (algorithms)
- Large programs are divided into smaller programs known as functions
- Most of the functions share global data
- Data move openly around the system from function to function
- Functions transform data from one form to another
- Employs top-down approach in program design
