## The Roots of DSP

Digital Signal Processing is distinguished from other areas in computer science by the unique type of data it uses: **signals**. DSP is the mathematics, the algorithms, and the techniques used to manipulate these signals after they have been converted into a digital form.

DSP has revolutionized many areas in science and engineering:
- Space
  - Space photograph enhancement
  - Data compression
  - Intelligent sensory analysis by remote space prebes
- Medical
  - Dignostic imaging
  - Electrocardiogram analysis
  - Medical image storage/retrieval
- Commercial
  - Image and sound compression for multimedia presentation
  - Movie special effects
  - Video conference calling
- Telephone
  - Voice and data compression
  - Echo reduction
  - Signal multiplexing
  - Filtering
- Military
  - Radar
  - Sonar
  - Ordnance guidance
  - Secure communication
- Industrial
  - Oild and meneral prospecting
  - Process monitoring & Control
  - CAD and design tools
- Scientific
  - Earthquake recording & analysis
  - Data acquisition
  - Spectral analysis
  - Simulation and modeling
