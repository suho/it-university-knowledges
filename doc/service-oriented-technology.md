## What is Service Oriented Architecture

Service-oriented architecture is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network.

A service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently.

SOA aims to allow users to combine large chunks of functionality to form applications which are built purely from existing services and combining them in an ad hoc manner.

Users can also access these independent services without anyknowledge of their internal implementation.
