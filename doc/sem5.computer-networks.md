## Network Terminology

### Network Devices

**End-user devices**: computers, printers, scanners,, and other devices that provide services directly to the user.

**Network devices**: include all the devices that connect the end-user devices together to allow them to communicate.
    - Repeater: Regenerate and Retime network signals at the bit level.
    - Hubs: Take a group of hosts and allow the network to see as a single unit.
    - Bridges: Provide connections between LANs
    - Workgroup switches: Add more intelligence to data transfer management, transfer the data **only** to the connection that needs that data.
    - Routers: Have all capabilities listed above.

### Network Topology

Network topology defines the structure of the network

### Network Protocols

A Protocol is a formal description of a set of rules and conventions that govern a particular aspect of how devices on a network communicate.

Protocol suites are collections of protocols that enable network communication from one host through the network to another host.

### Local-area Networks (LANs)

- Local share files and printers efficiently
- It makes internal communications possible

### Virtual Private Network (VPN)

A VPN is a private network that is constructed within a public network infrastructure such as the global Internet.

## Bandwidth

Bandwidth has beeen defined as the **amount of information** that can flow through a network **in a given time**.
