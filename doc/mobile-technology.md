## iOS

### Architecture

Architecture of iOS is a layered architecture. At the uppermost level iOS works as an intermediary between the underlying handware and the apps you make. Apps do not communicate to the underlying hardware directly.

Apps talk with the hardware through a collection of well defined system interfaces. These interfaces make it simple to write apps that work constantly on devices having various hardware abilities.
