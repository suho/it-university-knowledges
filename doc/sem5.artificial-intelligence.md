## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence is:
- Thinking Humanly
- Thinking Rationally
- Acting Humanly
- Acting Rationally

### Acting Humanly

- Natural Language Processing
- Knowledge Representation
- Automated Reasoning
- Machine Learning
- Computer Vision
- Robotics
  
### Thinking Humanly

- General Problem Solver (Regression Planning System)
  - Newell and Simon, 1961
- Cognitive Science
  - Wilson and Keil, 1999

### Thinking Rationally

- The "law of thought" approach
  - Logical Reasoning
- Two main obstacles
  - Difficult to demonstrate the reality issues.
  - Computer can not calculate the big problems.

### Acting Rationally

- The rationally agent approach
  - Situations
  - Intelligent Agents
  - Probabilistic Reasoning
  - Making Complex Decisions

### Foundation for Artificial Intelligence

- Philosophy
- Mathematics
  - Logic
  - Computation (Algorithm)
  - Probability
- Economics
  - How should we make decisions so as to maximize payoff?
- Neuroscience
- Psychology
  - How do humans and animals think and act?
- Computer Engineering
  - How can we build an efficient computer?

### History

#### 1950 - 1965

- Game Playing
  - Generate and Test
  - Exhaustive search
- Theorem Proving

#### 1965 - 1975

Want to make an computer understand human through natural language

- Semantic Network
- Cconceptial Graph
- Frame
- Script

-> Unsatisfactory phase

#### 1975 - Present

- Neural Network
- Hidden Markov Models
